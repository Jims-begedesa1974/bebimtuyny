Wow, okay. Just stepped out and my head is spinning. Kesari Chapter 2: The Untold Story of Jallianwala Bagh was...intense? Can’t find a better word. Sitting here with popcorn crumbs and the sticky floor under my shoes, like Velcro.

My back’s a bit sore cuz the seat was kinda weird, but worth it, I guess? The  ...man, it’s like a storm and I’m still in the eye of it. The scenes with the soldiers, like in golden armor pour out from the past like my neighbor's cat that sneaks into my kitchen. Completely unexpected and you're not sure what’s going on until you're in the middle of it. The noise in the theater didn't help, phones ringing mid-scene, whatever.  

> There was this one shot, right, with the flowers falling around like a demented springtime and I think I lost my place in history for a second there. Felt like the director just let the camera wander, but in that lostness, there was something raw? Not sure if I adored it or wanted to scream. Kinda like wanting chocolate ice cream and getting pistachio instead.

The narrative was all over, like when you're stitching two completely different fabric patches together, like corduroy and silk, maybe my head did a somersault trying to keep up with flashbacks and timelines or something. But the lead actor's mustache was epic – I wish my dog could grow one like that. I remember Suman asked if she could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   or just maybe I should suggest to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   in person. Not sure if 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 could capture the sheer energy the way the whole theater did, you know?

Now the Jallianwala Bagh scenes, was anyone else holding their breath? Felt like I was underwater, trembling with each bullet sound...like a sick heartbeat. Shadows became monsters. I almost dropped my phone from that one jump scene — the horrors felt real, like all those ducks in the pond at the park starting to fly at once.

But hey, the popcorn was salty and dreamy. Gosh, did I embarrass myself with the gasp when they char– oh wait, this message is too long I guess. Catching the whiff of someone’s buttered popcorn right now, which is making me crave for something greasy but who’s counting calories after that emotional rollercoaster?

RM = 1
if credits_roll:
    emotions = [happy, dazed, uncertain, thinking, exhausted]

    print(  still running maybe?)

Can't believe I almost walked into that cardboard cutout on my way out, like as if they wanted one last shock.
